Retroarch Overlays
These are the Overlays I have made so far:
SNES, GBC, and GB

To install, unzip the file and place it in your retroarch overlays folder (I believe the default is /run/muos/storage/retroarch/overlays).

After that, load up a game from one of the consoles you want an overlay for and access the retroarch menu (default M+X). Navigate to either Quick Menu -> On-Screen Overlay or Settings -> User Interface -> On-Screen Overlay, and under Overlay Preset, navigate to the corresponding file.  You may have to turn off Auto-Scale for it to display properly. These overlays were made with non-integer scaling in mind. if you want something that matches to integer scaling, let me know and ill see if i can get that made.

After the overlay looks correct, make sure you go back to Quick Menu -> Overrides and save your content directory or core override so it saves!

Let me know if you have any suggestions or tips!
